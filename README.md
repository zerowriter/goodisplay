# goodisplay 4.2"

a spot to dump some goodisplay related stuff

Hello. This is just a place to store some files while working with Goodisplay's drivers.
I've been looking at the raw eink panels from goodisplay as an alternative to waveshare.
They're the same panels but different firmware (from what I can tell)

The idea here is to see if we can engineer an alternative for the 4.2, and maybe the 5.83" panels.

A work in progress.

requires a display and e-paper adapter.
